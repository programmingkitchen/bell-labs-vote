Founded on the Bowery in New York City by Hilly Kristal in 1973, <strong>>CBGB</strong was originally
intended to feature its namesake musical styles, but became a forum for American
punk and new wave bands like the Ramones, Blondie, Talking Heads, Misfits, Television,
Patti Smith Group, The Dead Boys, The Dictators, The Cramps, and Joan Jett.
