<strong>Glenn Miller and His Orchestra</strong> was an American swing dance band formed by
Glenn Miller in 1938. Arranged around a clarinet and tenor saxophone playing
melody, and three other saxophones playing harmony, the band became the most
popular and commercially successful dance orchestra of the Swing
era and one of the greatest singles charting acts of the 20th century.
