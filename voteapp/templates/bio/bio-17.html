<strong>John Cage</strong> was an
American composer, music theorist, artist, and philosopher.
A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music,
and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the
leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded
him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century.
He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly
through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was
also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives.
