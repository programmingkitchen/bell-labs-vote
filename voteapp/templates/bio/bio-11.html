<strong>The Beatles</strong> was an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.
With a line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison
and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most influential band of all time.
The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular
music's recognition as an art form.[2] Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock
and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional
pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from
ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock.
