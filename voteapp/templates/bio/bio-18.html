<strong>Charles Parker (Bird)</strong> was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Parker was a
highly influential jazz soloist and the leading figure in the development
of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique
and advanced harmonies. Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso, and he introduced
revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of
altered chords, and chord substitutions.
