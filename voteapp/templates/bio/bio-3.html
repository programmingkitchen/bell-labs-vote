<strong>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</strong>
A Homeric journey through Mississippi during the Depression--or rather,
through all of the images of that time and place that have been trickling
down through pop culture ever since. The soundtrack, produced by T-Bone Burnett,
uses bluegrass, country, gospel, blues, and folk music appropriate to the time period.
